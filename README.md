This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in JavaScript related to variable hoisting.  The original `bug.js` file uses `var` which exhibits unexpected behavior when hoisting is involved.  The solution in `bugSolution.js` addresses this using `let` or `const` to enforce block scoping and avoid the hoisting issue.  This clarifies the differences in variable declarations and avoids common pitfalls.
